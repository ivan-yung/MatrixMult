**MatrixAccel**


Matrix multiplication implimented in hardware using **verilog** hardware description language, and simulated in modelsim

Task 1) includes the schematics and test files for a **MAC** (Multiply Accumulate Module)

Task 2) control module, and addressing registers for **8x8 matrix multiplication**

Task 3) Dual MAC architecture for **8x8 matrix multiplication in 256 Clock Cycles**

Task 4) 4 MAC parallel design for **8x8 matrix multiplication in 134 Clock Cycles**
